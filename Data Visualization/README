Technical Analysis Indicators:

-  Ichimoku Cloud: This provides information on future price movements and potential support/resistance levels. It's a comprehensive indicator that defines support/resistance, identifies trend direction, gauges momentum, and provides trading signals.

-  Rate of Change: This is a pure momentum oscillator that measures the percent change in price from one period to the next. In general, prices are rising as long as the ROC remains positive. Conversely, prices are falling when the ROC is negative.

-  Supertrend: The SuperTrend indicator is a popular technical analysis tool used by traders and investors to identify the direction of a trend and potential entry and exit points in the financial markets.

-  Simple Moving Average: The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is a widely used technical analysis tool that helps traders and investors smooth out price data to identify trends over a specified period of time. 

-  Momentum Indicators: These are tools used to identify the speed of price movement or the velocity of price changes, like the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). 

-  Money Flow Index (MFI): This is a momentum indicator that uses both price and volume to measure buying and selling pressure. Itâ€™s also known as the volume-weighted RSI. 

-  Relative Strength Index (RSI): This measures the speed and change of price movements. RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Traditionally, an RSI above 70 is considered overbought, and an RSI below 30 is considered oversold.

-  Stochastic Oscillator: This momentum indicator compares a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period of time. The sensitivity of the oscillator to market movements is reducible by adjusting that time period or by taking a moving average of the result.
