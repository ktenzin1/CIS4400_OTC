# CIS4400_Group_Project
Technical Analysis of the OTC Market and Applying Knowledge and Skills learnt from Professor Jefferson in CIS 4400 to do a real-world project

1)	Business Problem
   
I. Brief Description of the OTC Markets Group 
The Over-the-counter (OTC) market is a market to connect investors with companies to trade securities that are not listed on major exchange venues like the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ. About 12000 U.S and global securities are traded on the OTC market. The OTC website states, "We enable investors to easily trade through the broker of their choice and empower companies to improve the quality of information available for their investors". 

According to the OTC website, securities from the following industries are traded on the OTC market "financial services, metals & mining, oil & gas, pharmaceuticals & biotechnology, healthcare, telecommunications, technology, retail, media, utilities, and many more".

The total annual dollar volume was $507 billion as of December 31, 2022.

II. Give the requirements and any missing requirements you have found
1. Breakdown per year, quarter, month, 
2. Breakdown by country, sector (this will be our research), by security type
3. You are required to do Technical Analysis (Use the following library https://github.com/bukosabino/ta)
4. On the dashboard, for each security, I need to see those technical indicator for 3 months, 6 months 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, as well as the prices for these specific periods. If I want to see 3 months technical indicator, it you should give it to me based on the current last date, meaning December 2023

1.  Breakdown per Year, Quarter, Month:  
- This involves examining market data over different periods to identify trends and patterns. A  yearly analysis might show long-term market trends, while a quarterly and monthly analysis can reveal shorter-term fluctuations and seasonal effects. 

2.  Breakdown by Country, Sector:  
- Country analysis: Different countries can exhibit varying market dynamics due to factors like economic policy, currency strength, and local market regulations. 
-  Sector analysis: Different sectors respond differently to economic cycles. For example, technology stocks might behave differently than energy stocks. 

3.  Breakdown by Security Type:  
- OTC markets can trade a variety of financial instruments, such as equities (stocks)  that are not listed on a central exchange,  bonds  (debt securities), and derivatives  (which derive their value from an underlying asset). 

4.  Technical Analysis Indicators:
-  Average Directional Index (ADX): This measures the strength of a trend. An ADX value above 25 typically indicates a strong trend, while below 20 suggests a weak trend.

-  Fibonacci Retracement: These are horizontal lines that indicate where possible support and resistance levels are likely to occur. They are based on Fibonacci numbers. 

-  Ichimoku Cloud: This provides information on future price movements and potential support/resistance levels. It's a comprehensive indicator that defines support/resistance, identifies trend direction, gauges momentum, and provides trading signals.

-  Standard Deviation:
  
-  Volume Indicators: These include indicators like the On-Balance-Volume (OBV), which uses volume flow to predict changes in stock price.

-  Parabolic SAR: This indicator provides potential reversals in the market price direction of traded goods such as securities. 

-  Stochastic Indicator:

-  CCI Indicator:

-  Aroon Indicator:

-  Trend Indicators (like Moving Averages): These help smooth out price action and filter out the noise to identify the direction of the price trend. 

-  Average True Range (ATR): This measures market volatility by decomposing the entire range of an asset price for that period.

-  Supertrend:

-  Trading Indicators:

-  Momentum Indicators: These are tools used to identify the speed of price movement or the velocity of price changes, like the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). 

-  Money Flow Index (MFI): This is a momentum indicator that uses both price and volume to measure buying and selling pressure. It’s also known as the volume-weighted RSI. 

-  Rate of Change:

-  Relative Strength Index (RSI): This measures the speed and change of price movements. RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Traditionally, an RSI above 70 is considered overbought, and an RSI below 30 is considered oversold.

-  Volume:
  
-  Stochastic Oscillator: This momentum indicator compares a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period of time. The sensitivity of the oscillator to market movements is reducible by adjusting that time period or by taking a moving average of the result. 

Note: Technical analysis is based on the idea that historical price movements and patterns can help forecast future price movements. However, it's important to note that these indicators are not foolproof and should be used as part of a broader analysis strategy. Technical analysis is often used in combination with fundamental analysis, especially for long-term investments, as market conditions can change and affect the relevance of past patterns. 
 
2)	Business Impact
 
 You will need to consider any risks, cost, and benefits that are related to this project.  How the persona, company will benefit from it? 
 
[It is useful if you can provide an estimated impact of your target/moonshot analysis. If things go exactly as planned, how much does your company beneﬁt? If things go much better than planned, how much does your company beneﬁt?]
 
 
3)	Business Persona 
 
Who are going to be the people who use the system? Who are the actors of the system?  

4)	Data
The data sources that you are going to use and the metadata associated with them. 
 
 
[Tell us (at least approximately) how large your dataset is. Highlight both the strengths and weaknesses of your dataset(s).]
 
 
5)	Methods
In this section, we will highlight some of the key tools and elements of our tech stack that we will be using for this project. As we learn and build upon our skills during this program, we hope to add additional tools to this section and improve upon some of our initial assumptions.

6)	Data Tools
Data Storage: What are the data storages that you are going to use.
 
Data Processing: How are you going to process/ingest the data? 
 
Data Orchestration: Are you using any type of tools to automate your data pipeline
 
7)	Interface
The final interface will be a web-based application where the Persona can visualize the results.  People should be able also to connect to your  data using Tableau/PowerBI and do their own analysis.
